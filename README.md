## Main goal

To build a form in flutter, one need to write a huge amount of code. And it's a repetitive work most of the times. `flutter_dynamic_forms` comes to our rescue in such scenarios.
<!-- So `flutter_dynamic_forms` reduces our time in development and reduces such repeatitive coding. -->

## Specialities

The idea behind this project is to be able to define your components either in a `JSON format` on the server side or in a `Map<String,dynamic>` format locally in the flutter code.
